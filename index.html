    Mami Wata, the revered water spirit known as Mother Water, embodies beauty, protection, allure, and danger across Africa and the African Atlantic. Depicted as a mermaid or snake charmer, her imagery reflects influences from various cultures. Associated with prosperity and trade, she emerged during the era of growing trade between Africa and the world, carried by enslaved Africans to the Americas where she took on new forms like Lasir√®n and Yemanja. This exhibition explores Mami Wata's visual cultures and histories, illustrating how art shapes beliefs, globalization, and capitalism, underscoring the power of images and ideas in society.
